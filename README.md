## What is Anubis?

Anubis is a self-hosted threat intelligence platform that runs on a schedule and automatically:

- Pulls from **40+ threat intelligence sources** (NVD, CISA KEV, Exploit-DB, MalwareBazaar, URLHaus, AlienVault OTX, Shodan, AbuseIPDB, and more)
- Enriches **every single CVE** with **EPSS scores**, **MITRE ATT&CK mappings**, **NVD detail enrichment**, and **MSF module coverage** — no caps, full coverage
- Deduplicates and cross-correlates threats across all sources
- Risk-scores every threat using CVSS, EPSS, KEV status, exploit availability, and attacker activity
- Persists all threat data to **PostgreSQL** with full historical tracking and upsert logic
- Generates a formatted **Excel database** with color-coded severity and dashboard charts
- Generates an **interactive HTML dashboard** (~2MB rich report) served live at [anubispro.duckdns.org](https://anubispro.duckdns.org)
- Sends a full **threat report email** with both files attached via Postfix + Gmail relay
- Cleans up after itself — auto-deletes stale backups and syncs the latest dashboard to Nginx on every run
- Defends itself: the EC2 instance running Anubis is protected by a **Wazuh agent** with custom detection rules, FIM, and active response

## 🛡️ Host Defense

The EC2 instance running Anubis is monitored by a **Wazuh agent** deployed in full defense mode. This is not just a SIEM demo — it's actively protecting the platform that generates the threat intel.

**What's live right now:**

- Full log collection across auth, syslog, kernel, dpkg, apt, mail, cloud-init, postgresql, chrony, SSM, journald, dmesg, and **UFW firewall logs**
- File integrity monitoring on `/etc`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, SSH keys, and `/home/ubuntu/Anubis` in **realtime mode**
- Custom detection rules tuned for brute force, reverse shell attempts, malware staging, off-hours SSH, privilege escalation, and new user creation
- **Active response** enabled — firewall-drop fires automatically on confirmed brute force
- **VirusTotal integration** — file hashes from FIM alerts are checked against VT automatically
- **Email alerting** — Wazuh alert emails delivered in real time for Level 6+ events
- **UFW firewall** hardened — default deny inbound, SSH locked to authorized IPs, Wazuh ports restricted

Check the `screenshots/` directory for sanitized real alert examples captured live from the platform.

## 🌐 Public Deployment (New in v6.1)

Anubis is now live on the public internet. The interactive HTML dashboard auto-updates on every run.

**Stack:**
- **Nginx** reverse proxy serving static dashboard
- **Let's Encrypt** SSL certificate via Certbot
- **DuckDNS** free subdomain — `anubispro.duckdns.org`
- **UFW** firewall — hardened inbound rules, sensitive ports locked

**Security hardening on the public endpoint:**
- HTTPS only — HTTP redirects to 443
- TLS 1.2 / 1.3, strong cipher suite
- `.py`, `.log`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, `.sql`, `.db`, `.env` files blocked at Nginx level
- Hidden files and internal directories (`__pycache__`, `.git`, `venv`) denied
- No backend exposed — pure static file serving (Phase 6)
- Phase 7 FastAPI proxy already stubbed in config, one uncomment away

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

PostgreSQL backend with:

- `threats` table — 40+ columns including Phase 6 dashboard metadata
- `runs` table — every Anubis execution logged with stats
- 13 indexes — optimized for priority, severity, EPSS, KEV, full-text search, and JSONB
- 4 views — `critical_threats`, `kev_threats`, `trending_threats`, `threat_stats`
- Upsert logic — existing threats updated with latest scores, `run_count` and `severity_changed` tracked
- `first_seen_at`, `last_seen_at`, `is_trending`, `dashboard_tags` — full historical tracking

**2,896+ threats in DB across multiple runs.**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Requirements**

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Nginx
- Certbot (`python3-certbot-nginx`)
- Postfix (for email delivery via Gmail relay)
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- AWS EC2 t3.micro or equivalent (1GB RAM minimum)
- **10x NVD enrichment speed:**

# HTTPS
# Wazuh agent comms
# Wazuh enrollment
# Wazuh API locked

```
